I became involved in an argument about modern painting a subject upon which I am spectacularly ill informed however many of my friends can become heated and even violent on the subject and I enjoy their wrangles in a modest way I am an artist myself and I have some sympathy with the abstractionists although i have gone beyond them in my own approach to art i am a lumpist. two or three decades ago it was quite fashionable to be a cubist and to draw everything in cubes then there was a revolt by the vorticists who drew everything in whirls we now have the abstractionists who paint everything in a very abstracted manner but my own small works done on my telephone pad are composed of carefully shaded strangely shaped lumps with traces of cubism vorticism and abstractionism in them for those who possess the seeing eye as a lumpist i stand alone
